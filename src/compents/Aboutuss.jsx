<h1><u>ABOUT US</u> </h1>
<p>The <strong> ATPtechhub  </strong> is a new technology training institute conceived on the concept of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). We are saddled with the mission to equip young minds to be able to compete technologically with their peers in the developed world.</p>
<p>As the world evolves and nations diversify, it is eminent that our young minds are not left incapacitated. Not only is technological illiteracy real, it is a major problem that is often overlooked. It increases dependency on a more adapted individual or work force and limits a personâ€™s ability to survive in our current world of technology. More so than ever, the programming language/web design and development training is a program structured to build and equip future generations to become tech savvies that can advance into gurus and become world developers</p>
